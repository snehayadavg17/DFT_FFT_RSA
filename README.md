# DFT_FFT_RSA
The aim of the project is to calculate the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a list of complex numbers. The DFT is a mathematical operation that converts a signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. This can be useful for analyzing the frequency components of a signal, such as a sound wave or an image.
